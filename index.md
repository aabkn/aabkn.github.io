# About me

I am a second-year PhD student at ETH Zurich working with Prof. Afonso Bandeira at Mathematics Department.
My research interests include
high-dimensional statistics, computational complexity, statistical physics, and stochastic optimization.
In particular, I work on understanding of phase transitions and
computational hardness of statistical inference.

Here is a link to my full [CV](/files/CV_Apr24_Kireeva.pdf).
